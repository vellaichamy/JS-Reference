What is closure and it's use cases with example? A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.

How to read form elements value and how to set value to them using JavaScript
        1.  function test() {   
            }
            test.prototype.name = "John Doe";
            var test1 = new test();
            test1.prototype.name = "Jane Doe";      // We can't access the prototype directly from an instance object.
                                                    // We can use __proto__ which is not recommended
            var test2 = new test();
            console.log(test2.name);                // "Jane Doe" - All the instance objects will have access to the same prototype object

        2.  function test() {
                y = 20;
                var x = 10;
            }
            test();
            console.log(y);                         // 20 - 'y' will be attached to global scope

        3.  var myobj = {
                foo : "bar";
                myfunc: fucntion(){
                    var self = this;
                    console.log("1st --" + this.foo);
                    console.log("2nd --" + self.foo);
                    (function(){
                        console.log("3rd --" + this.foo);
                        console.log("4th --" + self.foo);
                    })();
                }
            }

            myobj.myfunc;                           // Just prints the function
            myobj.myfunc();                         // 1st -- bar
                                                    // 2nd -- bar
                                                    // 3rd -- undefined
                                                    // 4th -- bar

        4.  var a = new Object();
            var b = new Object();
            var c = new Object();
                                                    // An object's key must be type of string
            c[a] = "bar";                           // So, whenever a primitive is used as a key, it will be converted to string and then used as a key
                                                    // For example,\

                                                    // And whenever an object is used as a key, the return value of toString() method of that object is used as key
                                                    // For example \
                                                        TYPE                    CODE                        KEY \

                                                        [10]                -> Array.of(10).toString()  -> "10" \
                                                        function            -> function(){}             -> "function(){} \
                                                        Custom toString()   -> toString = function(){return "custom object"};   -> "custom object"

            console.log(c[a]);                      // "bar"

        5.  var def;
